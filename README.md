# Changes from the Original Version
See [here](CHANGES.md)

# Conflicts
- [Better Equipment Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878772496) - This has its functionality built in
- [TTT Damage Logs](https://github.com/Tommy228/tttdamagelogs) - Possibly only conflicts with version 3.1 but I have not personally tested it
- [TTT DeadRinger](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2045444087) - Overrides several scripts that are core to TTT that this also overrides (notably, the scoreboard and client initialization). As a workaround, you can use [this version](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2045444087) instead.
