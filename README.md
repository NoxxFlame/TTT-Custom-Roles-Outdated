# Changes from the Original Version
See [here](CHANGES.md)

# Conflicts
- [Better Equipment Menu](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=878772496) - This has its functionality built in
- [TTT Damage Logs](https://github.com/Tommy228/tttdamagelogs) - Possibly only conflicts with version 3.1 but I have not personally tested it
- [TTT DeadRinger](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2045444087) - Overrides several scripts that are core to TTT that this also overrides (notably, the scoreboard and client initialization). As a workaround, you can use [this version](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=810154456) instead.

# FAQs
**This lags everyone when I play on my peer-to-peer (aka listen, aka local) server/game**\
Everyone needs to subscribe to this workshop item, not just the host. I'm not sure why that is, it's the same for every version of this addon not just mine.\
\
I would suggest making a workshop collection of the addons you have and then having your friends subscribe to them all.

**How do I change X, Y, or Z?**\
Check out the [Configuration](CONVARS.md) page and add the setting value you want in your server.cfg. If you don't see a setting for what you want to change, leave a comment and I'll either help you find it or try to add one.
