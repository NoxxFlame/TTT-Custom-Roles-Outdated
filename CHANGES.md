# Changes
- Changed role spawning to not do hidden math to determine role chance. Uses the CVars values directly instead.

# Fixes
- Fixed conflicts with certain buyable weapons (like the Time Manipulator). Thanks Angela and Technofrood from the [Lonely Yogs](https://lonely-yogs.co.uk/) Discord!
- Fixed traitor voice chat so regular vanilla Traitors can do global chat (or traitor-only chat by using the "Sprint (Walk quickly)" keybind) like the other traitor roles
- Fixed compatibility with [Dead Ringer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=810154456) weapon so that Detectives who use it don't have their target icon ("D" over their head) visible when they should be cloaked
- Fixed various other errors
